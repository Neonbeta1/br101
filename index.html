					Hey there. If you're here, that means you want to report a bug in a mod! Well, you're in the right place. Before we get started, though, let's look at some important things (click on any to see why it's important):<br><br>
					<div id="why0" class="why">Are you in the latest version of the mod?</div>
					<div id="why-expl0" class="why-expl">
						Reporting bugs in old versions of mods is a bad idea, these bugs might have been fixed in newer versions of the mod and you might just be wasting the modder's time. If you're using a modpack, try updating the mod manually, and if it works, ask the modpack's creator(s) to update the mod.
					</div>
					<div id="why1" class="why">Are you in the latest version of Forge?</div>
					<div id="why-expl1" class="why-expl">
						Having the latest version of Forge is crucial to pointing out bugs. If you can reproduce an issue with an old version of Forge, but not with the latest version then it works fine. Old versions of Forge should be not be supported, as the new ones, more often than not, contain major bugfixes.
					</div>
					<div id="why2" class="why">Are you using vanilla Forge (not MCPC+)?</div>
					<div id="why-expl2" class="why-expl">
						MCPC+ is a bridge between Spigot (a fork of Bukkit, providing better optimization and some other features) and MinecraftForge. In sum, it allows you to use Bukkit Plugins and Forge Mods in the same server.<br><br>
						Due to the ways it uses to create this bridge, it's to expect some mods to be incompatible with it. Mods are not meant to be built for MCPC+ by default, if some functionality is not working with MCPC+ installed but works fine without it, report the issue to the MCPC+ team instead.
					</div>
					<div id="why3" class="why">Are you using Optifine?</div>
					<div id="why-expl3" class="why-expl">
						Optifine, as implied by it's function, changes the basic way things are drawn on the screen. Some mods depend on complex rendering sequences to get the desired visual effect for their blocks/items/entities/whatever. If something looks out of place with optifine installed, try it without optifine and see if it looks right, and if it does, the issue has to do with the interaction between the mod and optifine.<br><br>
						As Optifine is a closed source mod, workarounds are not possible without technically violating the license. That's the main reason why most mods do not support optifine.
					</div><br><hr><br>
					After you've checked all of these out and are confident the issue doesn't lie in any of the problems above stated, by all means, carry on!
				</div>
				<div id="inst1" class="instructions">
					Start by briefly describing what the issue is, try to be as concise as possible. Make sure you highlight details, any cross mod interactions should be explained, the more you leave out, the harder it is to find the issue and fix it.<br><br>
					<div class="examples">Examples:</div>
					<b>Bad: </b><i>i tried to create the blocky thingymajig and my game crashed help please</i><br><br>
					<b>Good: </b><i>I was trying to create the Blocky Thingymajig, I gathered all the crafting components, when I pulled the item out of a Super Crafting Table from the SuperCrafting mod, my game crashed.</i>
				</div>

					<div class="examples">Examples:</div>
					<b>Bad: </b><i>potato</i><br><br>
					<b>Good: </b><i>raddish</i>
